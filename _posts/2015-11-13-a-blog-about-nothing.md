This is a sample post. I've just been invited onto the Grid beta. Which is pretty freaking awesome. And I have no idea what to say.

It's funny how, when you have nothing to say, you can fill space by talking about the nothing, that you don't have, and suddenly you're saying something. I'm sure there's a technical term for this, and when I can be bothered, I'll find it.
